# To-Do List Application

## Description
A fully functional and modular to-do list application built with Webpack. Designed for seamless task and list management with an intuitive UI, the app features:

- **Default Lists**: Tasks, Today, Important, and Planned.
- **Dynamic Task Assignment**: Tasks appear in multiple lists based on properties like due dates or importance.
- **Custom Lists**: Users can create, rename, and delete lists.
- **Task Details**: Add steps, due dates, and notes to tasks.
- **Interactive UI**: Smooth updates, counters for uncompleted tasks, and dark mode for accessibility.
- **Mobile Friendly**: Optimized for use on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Data Persistence**: Local storage ensures data is retained across sessions.
- **First-Time User Support**: A built-in tutorial ("Getting Started").

This project serves as an example of modular, object-oriented design and is ready for future scalability with database integration.
